# Changes that need to be made to the analysis pipeline

# TODO:
- Edit Pump_Probe to determine percent excitation
- Create Ghost_Imaging analysis notebook. This is in progress. The ghost imaging analysis is tedious. Hopefully will finish this tomorrow. (Flip it back around for testing)
- Do we need something to determine the Zn fluorescence pattern?
- Make notebook for spectrometer calibration. Not sure how this is going to go...

# Completed:
- Modify producer to output correct data
- Modify azimuthalBinning to output q-arrays for both masks that are the same
- Modify azimuthalBinning to do the correct geometry optimization
- Edit Compare_Runs.ipynb
- Edit Geometry_Calibration.ipynb
- Edit Knife_Edge.ipynb if needed (No edits requied)
- Edit Timetool_Calibration if needed (No edits required)
- Edit Mask_Maker if needed (Minor edits)
- Get xyz or mol files for DMP ground, 3pL, 3sL, 3sD, and DMHP?
