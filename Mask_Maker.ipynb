    "This notebook will be used to generate the cmask (overall) and the individual masks.\n",
    "I'm thinking that we can make each half mask seperately using the polygon feature, and then combine those masks with a general cmask to make the mask that actually goes into the calibration directory in the experiment folder. Then we can use the indivdual half masks and output them seperately into another dir in the exp folder and then we can point the producer to them so that we get two azavs.\n",

In a way, it scales large numbers down similarly to taking a log, but it works with negatives. The bounds that the user selects are what the user sees on the plot, __not__ the values before taking the arcsinh.\n",
